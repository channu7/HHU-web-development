        <p>Deep learning is an artificial intelligence (AI) method that teaches computers to
            process data in a way inspired by the human brain. Deep learning models can recognize
            complex pictures, text, sounds, and other data patterns to produce accurate insights and
            predictions. You can use deep learning methods to automate tasks that typically require human intelligence,
            such as describing images or transcribing a sound file into text. </p>
